# Visual Price Comparison Web Application

This Flask web application allows users to compare prices of products detected in images using the Google Cloud Vision API. Users can upload an image, and the application will extract URLs related to e-commerce sites and their corresponding prices.

#### it's still under development and not completely working on deployed server due to some issues.But it Works Properly on local host So try It

## Deployed Application

The live site for this application is accessible [here](https://price-comparison-site-3.onrender.com).

## Features

- **Image Upload:** Users can upload an image containing products they want to compare prices for.
- **Google Cloud Vision Integration:** Utilizes the Google Cloud Vision API to detect web entities in the uploaded image.
- **Price Scraping:** Scrapes prices from various e-commerce websites corresponding to the detected products.
- **Comparison Display:** Presents a comparison of prices for the detected products on the web page.

## How It Works

1. **Image Upload:** Users upload an image through the web interface.
2. **Web Entity Detection:** The application processes the uploaded image using the Google Cloud Vision API to detect web entities.
3. **Price Extraction:** Extracted URLs related to e-commerce sites are matched with predefined XPath expressions to scrape prices.
4. **Comparison Display:** The comparison results, including product URLs and prices, are displayed on the web page for users to view.

## Performance

- **Scalability:** The application is designed to handle multiple concurrent requests and can scale with demand.
- **Processing Time:** The processing time varies depending on the size of the uploaded image and the number of detected web entities. However, efforts have been made to optimize performance where possible.
- **Reliability:** The application aims to provide reliable price comparison results by utilizing established web scraping techniques and the Google Cloud Vision API.
